I have tried whole lot of other similar offerings (Firebase, etc) but moron me couldn't get it to work. So now you folks have an active community, i would like to know something before i start exploring this space thing. Apologies in advance if these following questions are childish, just that i am a moron. And feel free to delete them if it disqualifies and rated below as per your rules whatever. thanks!  So now that i have installed space, can i now create api using fastifyjs? and then run CRUD ops?  (watching a fastifyjs tutorial while writing this) If then, will i get an endpoint url so that i can make fetch calls from a frontend vue? so if then, can i expect that space has a feature for storing the data?  I might have more questions.
