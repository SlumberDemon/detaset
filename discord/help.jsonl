So in short my question is Is it possible to use Flet with Deta in any possible way or do have to stick with FastAPI, Flask or Starlette? Many thanks in advance. :deta_heart:", "attachments": [""], "date_time": "12/10/2022-05:50", "predicted_solution": "tl;dr deta supports running ASGI/WSGI apps, like those built using fastapi or flask. flet doesnt look like an ASGI or WSGI framework, rather more geared toward mobile/desktop ui with an option to serve your app as a webpage, so its probably not possible to use it with deta. you can try asking in their discord server if you can run it like an ASGI or WSGI app. thats about all i can say"}
